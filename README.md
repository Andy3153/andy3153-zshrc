# andy3153-zshrc

These are all the plugins and little scripts that I use in my .zshrc 

I saw this idea of posting my shell rc config here on https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line and thought it might be cool to try.

I made this mostly because I wanted an easy solution to backup my configs, but also because I wanted to play around with git and it made me organise my configs and other scripts I made.

Programs/plugins included:
  1. agnoster-zsh-theme (https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme)
  2. ddate (https://github.com/bo0ts/ddate)
  3. neofetch (https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)
  4. thefuck (https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)
  5. zsh-autosuggestions (https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
  6. zsh-syntax-highlighting (https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)


About the installation scripts:
The names are pretty self-explanatory, but I'll say it anyway
  1. install.sh copies every config in your home directory
  2. install_with-symlinks.sh links every config in your home directory
  3. uninstall.sh removes every config and restores your old ones
Also, all these do a backup of your already-existent configs in a folder named .zsh-backup


About the scripts:
You can just open them up in a text editor and you'll see their story in there ;)


Also, don't get confused if you see this repo get deleted and re-posted, I'm still learning how to use git.

Feel free to give me advice!
