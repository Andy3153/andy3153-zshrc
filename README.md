# andy3153-zshrc ![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Andy3153/andy3153-zshrc)
This is my .zshrc and all the plugins and little scripts that I use with it.

I saw this idea of posting my shell rc config here on [The Art of Command Line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) and thought it might be cool to try.

I made this mostly because I wanted an easy solution to backup my configs, but also because I wanted to play around with git and it made me organise my configs and other scripts I made.

## Themes
I've made many themes whenever I felt like shaking things up a little. You can easily apply them.

## Plugins included:

  1. [fast-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting)
  2. [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)

## Programs included:
  1. [ddate.sh](https://github.com/bake/ddate.sh)

## Other programs recommended to install are:
  1. Any lolcat implementation you prefer [lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat) [jaseg/lolcat](https://github.com/jaseg/lolcat) [tehmaze/lolcat](https://github.com/tehmaze/lolcat)

## Installation
To find out more about the install script, run it using the `--help` option. You can also run it with no option.

## About the other scripts
They are located in zsh/scripts. I made them because they're useful to me.

## Contributing
Feel free to give me advice on this, or even help me with it!
